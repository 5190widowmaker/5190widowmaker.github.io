1. Circuit Diagram
2. software 
This program is mainly written with C and circuitpython, where C is controlling the communication between the PICO4ML and qtpy rp2040,and the circuit python realized the functionality of the launchpad which is loaded onthe qtpy rp2040.
3. Soldering and case assambling

# project development
At first as we designed in proposal, we would like to design real time music game that will covert the analog sound signal to pitches and showing LED light on different pitches through FFT(Fast Fourier Transform). However, after talking with Professor Dalton, he recommanded us to use Adafruit Neotrellis to accomplish the goal,and we found a lot of interesting application on the Neotrellis,and we finally decided to make a real instrucment, a "launchpad", instead of a music game hardware based machine. 
For the first stage of design ,we use a 4x4 Neotrellis board to make a Whack a Mole game on it
